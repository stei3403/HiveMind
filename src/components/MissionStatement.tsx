        HiveMind is a public think tank built for people like you: dreamers,
        tinkerers, and creators with notebooks full of apps, inventions, and
        business ideas that never made it off the ground.
        <br /><br />
        We're flipping the script. This is a digital idea commons — a space where
        thoughtful, unfinished, or even half-baked ideas can be shared openly
        for others to explore, build, and improve.
        <br /><br />
        Because the best ideas deserve more than a dusty notebook.
        They deserve a chance to live.
